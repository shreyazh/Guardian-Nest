## Inspiration
Children and teens facing domestic abuse often lack a voice, support, or awareness of their rights. Guardian Nest was created to bridge this gap by providing education, crisis support, and a safe platform for victims to seek help.

- **Anonymous Chat & Community Forums** for safe discussions and peer support.

## How we built it
We leveraged:
- **Frontend:** React.js for an intuitive UI.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Firebase for secure data storage.
- **Database:** Firestore for real-time updates.
- **Security:** End-to-end encryption for anonymity and data safety.

- Integrating real-time crisis support without compromising privacy.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
